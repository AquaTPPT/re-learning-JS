                <h2>A couple of notes regarding the code:</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="center">
                <p>In the function sumInput(), there are 2 main ways of writing the code for the several different uses:
                    Through an if... else if... else statement or with the OR ( | | ) Brackets.</p>
                <p>At first, I thought about writing everything into the script and then comment the least efficient one, but that would be a little confusing to read after a while. Therefore, in order to note myself down in the future, I will write it in the HTML itself.</p>
                <p>Using the first method, it could be written like so:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <p> <span class="pink">if</span><span class="purple"> ( </span>value<span class="pink"> == </span><span class="blue"> null </span><span class="purple">) { </span><br><br><span class="pink">break </span> <br> <br><span class="purple"> }</span> <br> <br><span class="pink">else if </span><span class="purple">(</span><span class="pink">!</span><span class="blue">isFinite(</span>value<span class="blue">)</span><span class="purple">) { </span><br> <br> numbers.<span class="purple">pop</span><span class="blue">()</span> <br> <span class="pink">break </span> <br> <br><span class="purple">} </span> <br> <br> <span class="pink">else if </span><span class="purple">(</span> value <span class="pink">== </span><span class="blue"> '' </span><span class="purple">) {</span> <br><br> numbers.<span class="purple">pop</span><span class="blue">() </span><br> <span class="pink">break </span> <br><br><span class="purple"> } </span></p>
            </div> 
                <p>This is, however, very inefficient.</p>
                <p>A better way of writing this would be like so:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p> <span class="pink">if</span><span class="purple"> (</span>value <span class="pink"> == </span><span class="blue">null</span> <span class="pink">|| !</span><span class="blue">isFinite(</span>value<span class="blue">)</span><span class="pink"> || </span>value<span class="pink"> == </span><span class="blue">''</span><span class="purple">) {</span> <br> <br><span class="pink"> break </span><br> <br><span class="purple">}</span></p>
            </div>
            <p>But if you check the code, you'll see that it's written in yet another way. That is because in both of these ways, the array will still contain the final value, since no matter what value it is, it'll still push the value. Now, with the way it is written, if the values turn into strings or anything other than a number, it'll delete that value before continuing. the difference in power that this used is completely negligible.</p>
            <p>There is yet another thing though: In the command "<span class= "purple">sort</span><span class="orange">()</span>", there are also 2 ways of making this one bit: <br> After checking Stack Overflow, it was mentioned that you could make it with both the commands "sort" and "reverse, since "sort" sorts the numbers in ascending order, and "reverse" inverts the array order.</p>
            <p>However, this is NOT how the exercise solution does.</p>
            <p>instead, it shows the following:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <p><span class="pink">let</span>  arr<span class="pink"> =</span><span class="blue"> [5</span>,<span class="blue"> 2</span>,<span class="blue"> 1</span>, <span class="pink">-</span><span class="blue">10</span>,<span class="blue"> 8]</span> ;<br><br>arr.<span class="purple">sort</span><span class="blue">(</span><span class="orange">(a </span>,<span class="orange"> b)</span><span class="pink"> =></span><span class="orange"> b <span class="pink">-</span> a</span><span class="blue">)</span>; <br> <br><span class="blue">alert(</span> arr<span class="blue"> )</span> ;</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is preferable, since it uses one less command than the previous way.</p>
        </div>
